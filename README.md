## About

Kurenai (ç´…, jap. for "crimson") is a full-featured, user-based imageboard. Compared to other anonymous messageboards, under Kurenai each poster has a consistent username and avatar throughout all the forum and the admin has much more control over how the website behaves. 

### Under Kurenai:

- Posters can use BBcode language to make HTML lists, tables and more.
- Users can create their own boards, though the admin can enable/disable this feature.
- Admins can add their own custom "emojis" and CSS themes to the website.
- Security-conscious users can still browse the front-end without JavaScript.
- The admin can easily create application-level firewall rules to curb user creation from certain IP ranges.
