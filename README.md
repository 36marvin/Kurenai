## About Retroboard

Retroboard is a full-featured, text-based forum software inspired by traditional Japanese bulletin-boards. Under Retroboard:

- Posters can use BBcode language to make their posts feel more vivid and expressive.
- Users can petition to create their own boards.
- Admins can add custom emojis and CSS themes to the website.
- Creating an effective moderating staff is easier with its permission management options.

Retroboard runs on Laravel and Docker, which makes development and deployment much easier and more fluid. It uses Gulp instead of Laravel's default Vite, so it still supports Javascript-blocking front-end clients.
